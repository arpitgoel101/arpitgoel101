Welcome to the course Technical web design and usability programs.
===============================

Hey!

My name is Sam. I read web programming the program on BTH and in this course
May I learn how to Uses github and the framework anax-flat.
Github is a version management system that makes it easier to share
What you've done as well as keep an eye on how different versions of one's program have
been. Its main purpose is to prevent the collaboration between programmers
In different projects.

It will be interesting and see how the framework and github work. Join!
